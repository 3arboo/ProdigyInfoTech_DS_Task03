Analyse customer behaviour using a decision tree: Categorising the likelihood of purchase
Analyse customer behaviour using a decision tree: Categorising the likelihood of purchase

Project description:
Have you ever wondered how banks and businesses can identify potential customers to buy their products or services? This project provides the solution! Using a decision tree, we build a powerful model that can predict the likelihood of customers buying based on their demographic and behavioural data. We used real data from a Portuguese bank's marketing campaign to analyse customer behaviour more accurately and effectively.

Features:

- üì• Data import and processing: We imported the data and converted it into a model-ready format using state-of-the-art data processing techniques.
- üå≥ Building a decision tree: We developed a model using a decision tree to understand and analyse the complex relationships between variables and customer behaviour.
- üîç Model Evaluation: The performance of the model was measured using a confusion matrix and a variety of performance indicators to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
- üé® Optimised tree view: The decision tree presentation is optimised to be easy to read and understand, even for non-expert users.

Technologies used:

- Python - the leading programming language for data science.
- Pandas, NumPy - powerful tools for processing and analysing data.
- Scikit-learn - machine learning library used to build the model.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn - advanced tools for visualising data and making results more visible.

How to use:

1. Import the project and run it locally: Get the code and easily run it on your machine.
2. Customise the data: You can modify the code to experiment with different data or other scenarios.
3. View the results: Analyse and interpret the results to understand customer behaviour and make smarter marketing decisions.
